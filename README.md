# TridhyaTech Internship Projects

Welcome to the collection of projects I worked on during my internship at **TridhyaTech**. This repository showcases my journey of learning and building with Python â€” from writing simple scripts to developing fully functional web applications and APIs.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside

Each folder in this repository represents a different project or learning milestone. Here's a quick overview of what youâ€™ll find:

- **Python Basics** â€“ Practice scripts covering control flow, functions, file handling, and OOP.
- **NumPy & Pandas Projects** â€“ Hands-on projects focused on data manipulation and analysis using Python's core data libraries.
- **Flask Projects** â€“ Web applications built using Flask, including routes, templates, and basic web forms.
- **FastAPI Projects** â€“ Modern, high-performance API development using FastAPI with automatic documentation and routing.
- **Django Projects** â€“ Full-fledged Django web apps demonstrating models, views, templates, and admin panel usage.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ Interactive notebooks for experimentation, data exploration, and practice with code.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- FastAPI
- Django
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML, Templates (via Flask/Django)

## ðŸ§  What I Gained

Through these projects, I improved my understanding of:

- Writing clean and reusable Python code
- Working with real data using pandas and NumPy
- Building and structuring web applications with Flask and Django
- Designing RESTful APIs using FastAPI
- Debugging, version control, and project organization

## ðŸ“‚ Note

Each project is self-contained and meant to be explored independently. Some projects may require setting up virtual environments or installing dependencies â€” instructions (if needed) are provided within individual folders.
